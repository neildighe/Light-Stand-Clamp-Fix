# Light-Stand-Clamp-Fix
3D printed replacment for a broken clamp that was part of a light stand 

#Project

This was a simple solidworks part design that I did to replace a clamp on a lightstand. The replacment was printed in PLA but the orignal was cast metal. I did not use my personal 3D printer for this but instead my school's makerspace printer. 

I went  through two designs with the second one adding some much needed design changes since I incorrectly modelled the replacment at first. I also increased the tolerances of everything.
